# S&P 500 Data Analysis

Analysing the s&amp;p 500 dataset I got from Kaggle as a way to improve and develop my Data analysis skills using Excel and Power BI.

## Overview

This project analyzes financial data from the S&P 500 companies to identify trends, performance metrics, and insights. I did this project as a way to improve my Data analysis skills and to better understand the financial markets because the stock market it is one of the things I am very interested in and passionate about right now.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project were from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks

- **sp500_companies.csv**: Contains information about S&P 500 companies.
- **sp500_index.csv**: Contains historical data of the S&P 500 index.
- **sp500_stocks.csv**: Contains historical stock prices for S&P 500 companies.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For cleaning and transforming datasets and creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and easier workflow.

## Tasks: Analysis and Findings

### Performance Analysis

- Identified the best and worst-performing companies based on average closing prices.

### Sector Analysis

- Compared performance across different sectors.

## Analysing Datasets

Before tackling the business problem above I first of all cleaned and transformed the 3 datasets in the Project -datasets folder. Here are some of the things I did and why:

- **Resolved Large Dataset file (sp500_stocks.csv)**: This file is over 100mb in size and I initially couldn't push it to github because of the large file size. So I used Git LFS in my local repository to be able to handle the file and was able to seccessfully push it to Github remotely.

**Transformed and cleaned all 3 datasets:**

## Future Work

- Continue refining analysis with additional data.
- Enhance Power BI visualizations with more detailed metrics.

* Continue to clean and transfrom the updated datasets with accurate date types and better presentations.
